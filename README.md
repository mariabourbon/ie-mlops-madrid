# 🏠 Madrid House Price Prediction — MLOps Project

An end-to-end MLOps system for predicting Madrid house prices.  
It covers data preparation, model training (with MLflow tracking), Dockerized serving via FastAPI, and continuous deployment on Render.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview
Pipeline Stages

Data & Training – Cleans and processes housing data, trains a RandomForestRegressor, logs metrics to MLflow.

Model Serving – A FastAPI app serves predictions using the trained model.

Containerization – The app and model are packaged in a Docker image.

CI/CD Automation – GitHub Actions handle training, model artifact upload, and Docker builds.

Deployment – The Docker image is automatically built and deployed to Render with a live endpoint.

⚙️ Local Setup
1️⃣ Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
# or
source venv/bin/activate   # macOS/Linux

2️⃣ Install dependencies

For training:

pip install -r requirements-train-ci.txt


For serving:

pip install -r requirements-api.txt

3️⃣ Train the model locally
python src/train_model.py data/house_price_madrid_14_08_2022.csv


Model is saved to models/model.pkl

Metrics and parameters are logged in MLflow (mlruns/)

4️⃣ Run the API locally
uvicorn app.app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

🔁 CI/CD Workflows
🧠 train.yml

Runs on every push to main

Installs lightweight dependencies for Linux

Trains on a small sample dataset (data/madrid_sample.csv)

Uploads models/model.pkl as a GitHub Actions artifact

🐳 docker.yml

Downloads the model artifact

Builds the FastAPI Docker image

Pushes image to GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)

Optionally runs a smoke test
